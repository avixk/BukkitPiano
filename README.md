# BukkitPiano
Play the piano in Minecraft, with any MIDI controller!

This was originally written by Linus(glatteis). All I did was added particles and made it compatible with 1.16. I will continue to update this as new features come to mind. Thanks for your hard work Linus!

You can find more information on this plugin ~~and a compiled JAR download~~ __OUTDATED__ on Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bukkitpiano.115115/

Compiled jar is in the target folder. The jar will function as the plugin and client. Run the jar, enter your server ip and name, and connect!
If you want to stream midi from a program like FL Studio, LoopMIDI can help you accomplish that. https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
