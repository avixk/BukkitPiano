# BukkitPiano
Play the piano in Minecraft, with any MIDI controller!

This was originally written by Linus(glatteis). All I did was added particles and made it compatible with 1.16. I will continue to update this as new features come to mind. Thanks for your hard work Linus!

You can find more information on this plugin ~~and a compiled JAR download~~ __OUTDATED__ on Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bukkitpiano.115115/

I'll upload a compiled jar soon. Stay tuned.
